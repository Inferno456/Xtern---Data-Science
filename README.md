# Xtern---Data-Science

I programmed in Java using Processing.
DS-Data.csv and grid.svg must be in a folder called "data" to run the Processing code.
I have attached a screenshot (map.JPG) that shows the final result.
The bus is in blue, the scooters are in green and red. The green scooters are charged and the red ones are not.
I assumed the bus had coordinates 0.19, 0.19, as the x and y coordinates did not go up to 20.
